# BigData--UBB-FSEGA-project

I have conducted a research project in the R programming language, using the dataset obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance. I cleaned the dataset, identifying the dependent variable and independent variables. Through simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and decision tree analysis, I attempted to answer several research questions that served as the basis for my study.
